# 🎮 Game Theory Simulator

This project is a Python-based simulation of strategic decision-making games from Game Theory. It allows users to explore several well-known games, analyze strategies, and compute outcomes including Nash Equilibria and expected payoffs from mixed strategies.

## 🧠 Game Theory Concepts Covered

- Extensive Form & Game Trees
- Normal Form Representation
- Pure Strategies
- Mixed Strategies & Expected Payoffs
- Dominated Strategies
- Best Responses & Rationalizability
- Nash Equilibrium (Pure Strategy)

## 🎮 Simulated Games

- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Battle of the Sexes
- Matching Pennies
- Hawk-Dove Game

| `Part3_Youssef_Mahmoud.py`   | Mixed strategies + Expected Payoff calculation |
| `Part4_Mohamed_Mostafa.py` | Dominated strategies, best responses, rationalizability |
| `Part5_Mohamed_mohab.py` | Nash Equilibrium computation + matrix plotting |
| `payoffs_calc.py`          | Helper for expected value of mixed strategies |

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure you have the following installed:
#pip install matplotlib pandas networkx


2. Run each part independently:
- `Part1_Diaa_Ahmed.py` to visualize game trees.
- `Part2_Mahmoud_Reda.py` to show normal forms.
- `Part3_Mohamed_Mohab.py` to test mixed strategy payoffs.
- `Part4_Mohamed_Mostafa.py` to find dominated/rationalizable strategies.
- `Part5_Youssef_Mahmoud.py` to find Nash Equilibria.
